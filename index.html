  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <img width="250" src="picture.jpeg" alt="Teammates">

  <p>
    I’m a computer science major who enjoys figuring out how things work,
    especially when it comes to coding, websites, and problem-solving.
    I learn best by doing, and I like breaking things down so they’re easy
    to understand. I prefer things to be clear and straightforward, and
    that’s usually how I approach my own work too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of school, I’m pretty organized and like using spreadsheets to
    keep track of plans and ideas. When I’m not working on assignments or
    projects, you’ll probably find me playing or watching basketball.
    It’s something I really enjoy and use as a way to relax, stay active,
    and challenge myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, I’d describe myself as curious, laid-back, and always trying
    to improve. Whether it’s learning something new, staying organized,
    or putting time into basketball, I like making steady progress while
    keeping things fun and balanced.
